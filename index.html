				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hey, I am Roshini!</p>

				<p>I am currently a <b>CS graduate student</b> at the <b>University of Massachusetts Amherst</b>. My Master's program focuses on Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning. I see myself working on the pressing problems of environment and health care using technology and assisting the practitioners and environmentalists in the best possible way in a few months from now. I would like to apply my skills to work on interdisciplinary projects.</p>

				<p>During my Bachelor's at <b>BITS Pilani</b>, I was introduced to the expansive field of computer science, captivated by the theoretical foundations that drive powerful computations and how systems communicate. I worked on several interesting projects with data structures, databases and networks. I also interned at LV Prasad Eye Institute, Microsoft, and Walmart, aiming to develop robust, scalable products. I investigated anomaly detection in multivariate time series as an undergraduate student researcher with Dr. Saket Mishra, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/chittaranjanhota/">Prof. Chittaranjan Hota</a>. I then spent three years as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, working on Office Visio, where I honed my skills in development and deployment cycles and gained expertise in distributed systems.</p>

				<p>While I regularly immerse myself in the talks and course projects, I look forward to challenging and impactful work in machine learning. I find my strength in probability and statistics, and I am passionate about randomized algorithms. If you have interests in these fields and would love to chat about them, I would be glad to discuss them!</p>

Currently, I focus on theoretical machine learning and computer vision. </p>

					<p>I am a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science. I would love to apply my skills to the pressing problems of society, such as health care and the environment, and I believe technology can cater to the needs of these interdisciplinary fields. Before starting my journey as a graduate student, I completed a B.E. (Hons.) Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani and worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft RD.</p>
				
					<p>At the University of Massachusetts, I have pursued Advanced Machine Learning (COMPSCI 689), Algorithms for Data Science (COMPSCI 514), and Systems for Data Science (COMPSCI 532). While implementing neural networks, auto-encoders, and probabilistic models with rigorous analysis in the machine learning course, I learned to apply randomized streaming algorithms, probability inequalities, and spectral clustering in the algorithms course. In the systems course, I had hands-on data storing tools such as Hadoop, data processing tools such as PySpark, and Apache Flink, and distributed machine learning techniques, with a project depicting the fault tolerance of mocked Hadoop clusters. I am excited to start my coursework in Natural Language Processing (COMPSCI 685) and Intelligent Visual Computing in Spring 2024.</p>

					<p>Previously, at Microsoft, I delivered live, fluid experiences of curved connectors in Office Visio Online. Later, I received the Manager Choice Award for a hackathon project to make these curved connectors flexible and editable. I have improved the custom connectors' reliability and owned the connector's feature debt bugs. Later, I collaborated on an infrastructure to support multiple diagramming solutions and implemented Org charts on top of it. Apart from them, I conducted team-level weekly bug bashes for 50+ folks, encouraging a customer obsession culture. Also, I participated as Web Excellence Community Champ in collecting and refining articles for an internal monthly newsletter.</p>
					
					<p>As an undergrad at BITS Pilani, I explored the vastness of computer science while pursuing courses from systems like Operating Systems and Computer Architecture, to algorithm, math, and statistics courses to programming and network courses. During my undergrad, I got hands-on experience through projects and internships at the Srujana Innovation Center at LV Prasad Eye Institute, Microsoft, and Walmart Labs.</p>

					<p>While I regularly immerse myself in the talks and course projects in these fields, I look forward to challenging and impactful work in machine learning. If you have interests in these fields and would love to chat about it, I would be glad to discuss them!</p> -->
